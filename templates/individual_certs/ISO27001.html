    <h2>What is ISO?</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      ISO stands for the International Organization of Standardization, although
      it is not a direct acronym for that name. Because ISO is a multinational
      organization headquartered in Switzerland that operates in multiple
      languages, the organization developed its own abbreviation to avoid
      favoring one over another.
    </p>
    <p>
      ISO 27001 is sometimes referred to as ISO/IEC 27001:2022. The
      International Organization of Standardization and the International
      Electrotechnical Commission collaborated to develop this standard, which
      is known as ISO/IEC. The current version of the standard was published in
      2022.

          >ISO 27001 is widely regarded as the global gold standard for
          information security and supporting assets. Obtaining ISO 27001
          certification can help an organization demonstrate its security
          practices to potential customers all over the world.</strong

    <h2>What is ISO?</h2>
    <p>
      The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the
      International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) collaborated to develop
      the ISO 27001 standard, which enables businesses to design secure systems
      and demonstrate their security posture through a certification process.
      ISO 27001 focuses on a company's information security management system
      (ISMS), which is a set of policies and procedures that describe how an
      organization's processes contribute to data security.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain ISO 27001 certification, you must go through an audit that
      confirms you have met the compliance requirements and addressed any
      potential system risks. The standard consists of ten clauses and 114
      controls divided into fourteen categories that represent potential
      security measures that an organization may consider based on its needs and
      risks. While you must comply with all ten clauses, you do not need to
      implement all 114 ISO 27001 controls to become certified.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Who is ISO 27001 for? And why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of ISO 27001 certification is to demonstrate to your customers
      and prospects that security is a top priority for your company. While ISO
      27001 is not a legal requirement, your customers may require certification
      before doing business with you. ISO 27001 is applicable to organizations
      that handle or manage customer data, and it is particularly common among
      SaaS providers, data storage solutions, data processing and analytics
      tools, and other data-service platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When deciding whether or not to obtain ISO 27001 certification, you should
      also consider the location of your customers. SOC 2 is a compliance
      standard similar to ISO 27001 that is primarily used in North America but
      is gaining traction globally, whereas ISO 27001 is an international
      standard used all over the world. If you work with clients outside of
      North America, ISO 27001 is likely to be important to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many businesses decide they need both a SOC 2 and an ISO 27001
      certification if they have customers in North America and other countries
      around the world. Given that many of the controls overlap, it is common
      for organizations seeking compliance in both standards to undergo audits
      concurrently.
    </p>
    <p>
      A completed certificate can show prospects, customers, partners, and other
      stakeholders that your company has a strong information security posture.
      While ISO 27001 certification is not legally required, many large
      organizations insist on it for their vendors. This is done to ensure that
      the vendors with whom they do business protect their data properly.
