    <h2>What is NIST?</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S.
      Department of Commerce. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps businesses
      with setting standards for technology. NIST creates and manages standards
      related to technology, and data for promoting innovation and industrial
      competitiveness. Since its publication, the Framework for Improving
      Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity by NIST has been the most relevant
      document for the protection of information and it has become a necessity
      standard for many organizations that process a lot of sensitive
      information.

    <h2>Why Do Companies Need to Follow NIST?</h2>
    <p>
      Companies need to follow NIST for a number of important reasons. First,
      compliance with NIST is compulsory for companies that work with federal
      agencies. This requirement means ensuring that those contractors have good
      security measures put in place for the protection of sensitive government
      data. NIST provides a framework for managing cybersecurity risks. This is
      critical for making sure organizational data and systems are secure from
      cyber threats. Moreover, it indicates that the practices in the security
      measures taken to protect clients and their partners. Besides, compliance
      with NIST normally satisfies most of the requirements under other security
      standards, such as PCI DSS and SOX, this saves a lot of time and resources
      in the implementation of several standards of compliance.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>NIST CSF:</strong> This framework is designed for organizations
        that want to improve their cybersecurity posture and collaborate with
        other frameworks, such as PCI DSS and SOX.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NIST 800-53:</strong> This is the most targeted publication
        towards federal agencies and government contractors looking for
        full-scale security controls and risk management.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NIST 800-171:</strong> This framework is DoD
        contractors-specific in handling CUI with DFARS compliance to ensure
        data protection under these contractors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>What is the purpose of NIST 800 53?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of NIST SP 800-53 is to enhance the security of information
      systems utilized by the federal government. The purpose of NIST is to
      furnish guidelines in the form of a catalog of controls, which facilitate
      the development of secure information systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process takes you through categorizing your information system at a
      low-, medium-, or high-security level. With these categories, you compare
      the NIST 800-53’s security catalog and determine which applies to your
      firm.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Who needs to comply with NIST 800 53?</h2>
    <p>
      By mandate, US-based contractors and federal government agencies need to
      comply with NIST 800 53. However, other state and private organizations
      still use it as their security control framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re unaware of the systems on your network or if you’re caught
      off-guard by unexpected admin accounts or abnormal applications, you lack
      a baseline from which to manage your network.
    </p>
    <p>
      NIST 800 53 will serve as a bird’s eye view of your network, down to the
      tiniest details. This level of visibility is important.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>What is NIST 800 171?</h2>
    <p>
      NIST 800 171 is a publication that describes the required security
      standards and practices for non-federal organizations that handle CUI
      (Controlled Unclassified Information) on their networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      These guidelines must be complied with by any organization handling or
      storing sensitive, unclassified data on behalf of the US government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which initially
      published it in June 2015, then released a number of standards and
      publications to improve cybersecurity resilience in both the public and
      private sectors. NIST 800 171 has undergone regular updates in response to
      emerging technological challenges and new cyber threats.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>What is the purpose of NIST 800 171?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of NIST 800 171 is to establish guidelines for protecting
      sensitive data on the IT networks and systems used by federal contractors.
      By enforcing the best cybersecurity measures from government contractors,
      organizations are able to strengthen their federal supply chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document stresses the significance of customizing security measures to
      correspond with a company’s unique goal, operational needs, risk
      tolerance, and operating environment. By doing this, NIST 800-170 hopes to
      guarantee that cybersecurity operations are optimized and pertinent and
      successfully handle the particular difficulties that each organization
      faces.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Who does NIST 800 171 apply to?</h2>
    <p>
      NIST 800 171 applies to any organization that processes or keeps
      sensitive, unclassified information on behalf of the US government and is
      expected to adhere to the National Institute of Requirements and
      Technology Special Publication 800-171 (NIST SP 800-171) cybersecurity
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Departments of the US government depend on a variety of external
      institutions and service providers to run. Many of these crucial services
      include the processing and storage of sensitive data on the IT networks of
      contractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      NIST 800 171 continues to expand the range of organizations that it
      applies to. NIST 800 171 is currently a contractual requirement for the
      information systems of any non-federal organization that manages,
      transmits, stores, or safeguards Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
      for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), General
      Services Administration (GSA), or Department of Defence (DoD).
    </p>
    <p>Here are some of these organizations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Healthcare data processors</li>
      <li>Defense contractors</li>
      <li>Web and communication service providers</li>
      <li>Organizations providing financial services</li>
      <li>

    <hr />
    <h2>Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Non-compliance with the NIST standards can lead to severe penalties. For
      federal contractors, non-compliance can mean denial of contracts,
      especially for DoD contractors. An organization may also face financial
      fines and penalties for non-conformity to NIST standards. Moreover,
      non-compliance affects the organization's reputation since it leads to
      loss of trust from clients and stakeholders.
