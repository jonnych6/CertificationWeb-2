        GRC stands for Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance. It is an
        integrated approach that ensures organizations achieve their objectives,
        manage risks effectively, and comply with laws and regulations. GRC

          <strong>Governance:</strong>The framework of rules, practices, and
          processes by which an organization is directed and controlled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk Management:</strong>The process of identifying,
          assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's capital and
          earnings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance:</strong>Adherence to laws, regulations, standards,
          and ethical practices.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          <strong>Process Integration: </strong>Embed GRC practices into daily
          operations to ensure continuous monitoring and improvement.
