    <h2>How to reach SOC 2 Type 2 compliance</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      For many organizations, achieving SOC 2 Type 2 compliance is a critical
      milestone towards ensuring the reliability and integrity of their
      information security. To comply with SOC 2 Type 2, you need to establish
      and document robust internal controls over data protection, demonstrating
      that these controls are suitably designed to meet the specified objectives
      over a period of time. We've developed a detailed checklist to guide you
      through your SOC 2 Type 2 implementation and compliance process. This
      checklist includes the following steps:
