    <h2>How to reach PCI compliance</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      For many organizations, achieving PCI DSS compliance is a critical
      milestone for enhancing their security posture and gaining trust in the
      payments industry. To comply with PCI DSS, you must implement a robust
      security framework tailored to protect cardholder data. We've developed a
      detailed checklist to assist you in navigating the PCI DSS implementation
      and certification process. This checklist encompasses the following steps:
