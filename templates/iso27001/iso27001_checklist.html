    <h2>How to reach ISO 27001 compliance</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      For many organizations, obtaining ISO 27001 certification is a significant
      step toward expanding their business and entering new markets. To comply
      with ISO 27001, you must establish a strong and strategic information
      security management system (ISMS), which includes implementing data
      security best practices. We've created a comprehensive checklist to guide
      your ISO 27001 implementation and certification. This checklist includes
      the following steps:
