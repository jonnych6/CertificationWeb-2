  <h2>What is our project about?</h2>
  <p>
    Our capstone project is designed to empower individuals and organizations by
    providing essential resources related to cybersecurity certifications,
    including SOC and NIST. We aim to simplify the complex landscape of
    compliance by offering a comprehensive checklist that outlines the necessary
    steps for achieving certification. Our goal is to make the certification
    process more accessible and manageable, ensuring that users have the tools
    and knowledge they need to meet industry standards and enhance their
    cybersecurity posture.
